Description:
Plugin that outputs a WPMU (WordPress Multi User) site list as a CSV.

I run a WPMU server at my day job and have a need to run reports now and then.  Excel is a much easier place to do so and there was no easy way to get a list of all the sites, so here we are.

To Use:
Upload to wp-content/plugins and enable just like any plugin.

One caveat  ** IMPORTANT **
DO NOT enable this plugin from the Network Admin Dashboard.  It immediately says you don't have permissions to view the page anymore.  This is because the button it creates in the Dashboard is only visible to Super Admins.  I'm assuming that when you enable the plugin from the Network Admin Dashboard it doesn't like that.  Best to just not do it.  K?

So, install it like any other plugin, then go to the root site of your WPMU install and enable it there.
